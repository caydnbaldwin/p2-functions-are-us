        # Display list of all teams and allow the user to choose a team using a menu. Call the function again to let the user choose the opponent but do not display the team they chose previously. Remove that team from the list. Allow the user to select an opponent, and return team name. This function should receive a parameter but give it a default value if none is passed. You can use this function for both choosing the home team and the opponent team.
